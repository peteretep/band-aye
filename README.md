A rails web app to help manage community bands

* Member details
* Add gigs
* Member signup for gigs

Work in progress...

## Motivation
I play in an amazing band called Brass, Aye?

It's a great group of people, around 30 in total.

At the moment we manage the band through emails and shared spreadsheets.

My web development is out of practice, and I needed a project to get me back up to speed, so I decided to make a band management app for us.
It's super simple so far, just allows the admins to create gigs and people to sign up for gigs.

If the band decide to start using it, I'll add more features as we figure out what we need.


## App Details
* It's written in Rails
* I'm using the Bulma front end CSS library
