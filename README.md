A rails web app to help manage community bands

* Member details
* Add gigs
* Member signup for gigs

Work in progress...

## Motivation
I play in an amazing band called Brass, Aye?

It's a great group of people, around 30 in total.

At the moment we manage the band through emails and shared spreadsheets.

My web development is out of practice, and I needed a project to get me back up to speed, so I decided to make a band management app for us.
It's super simple so far, just allows the admins to create gigs and people to sign up for gigs.

## App Details
* It's written in Rails
* I'm using the Bulma front end CSS library
